# Glassdale PD: Cold Case Cyber Police

>"Maybe relocating to Glassdale won't be bad after all," you think as you enter the newly built police station in the center of town.
>
>But the truth is, you're just trying to muster up even the tiniest bit of a good attitude after you feel like you've been ripped from your favorite job so you could live in this tiny town to take care of your elderly step mother. You moved this past weekend from Washington D.C. where you worked on cyber cases with the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force and now have, unfortunately, 'downgraded' to a Detective job with the local police force.
>
>Shaking your head you think to yourself, "There's no way this new job will be anywhere near exciting as working to catch cyber terrorists every day..."
>
>As soon as you enter the building, Police Chief Renee Weston welcomes you with a large smile and a firm handshake.
>
>"Welcome! I can't tell you how excited we are to have a person of your expertise joining our team. We have a lot going on around here so I'll fill you in as we walk to your new office."
>
>You half-heartedly mutter back, "Um, yeah. Thanks. I'm glad to be joining the team."
>
> "Perfect! Well, let's get you set up with your laptop because I have the perfect job for you to take on for this first week," Renee excitedly says.
>
>Immediately, Renee dives into your new assignment, "So, we have this cold case... Five years ago, Glassdale's local businesses were being extorted for 'protection' money over a six month period. Until one night, where one brave shop owner, Carl, finally notified the police when he refused to pay our perp. After reporting it to the police,  Carl returned back to his shop where our masked perp was waiting for him with a loaded gun and threatened to kill him if he didn't pay up. Carl was thankfully able to run and escape, but later that night, the perp broke into the business and emptied the registers and the safe for revenge of going to the police."
>
>You're able to utter one shocked "Wow..." before Renee dives back into your assignment,"No one was ever able to solve it, and I'm hoping now that we have shifted all of our crime data from paper documentation to our new criminal database that you'll be able to use all of those fancy coding skills of yours to solve it."
>
>"Damn, that's a lot to digest on my first day but I'm up for the challenge and glad I can help out!" you reply eagerly, still shocked that this quiet, small town was victim to such an insane extortion scandal.
>
>"Amazing! Thank you so much. We're excited to have you on our team," says Police Chief Renee, as she hands you your laptop and exits your new office.
>
>You sit down at your clunky desk that's probably been around since the 80's. For the first time since you arrived in Glassdale, Illinois, you feel the slightest tinge of excitement for this new step in life.
