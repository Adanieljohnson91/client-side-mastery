# Don't Tell Anyone

You're used to all of the answers being hidden from you. Teachers hold them like sacred treasure and then determine if you are worthy of accessing it. Well, here at Nashville Software School, we do things differently. We're going to give you the answers before you even learn anything.

If you are on Windows, open Git Bash. If you are on OSX, open the terminal application.

```sh
cd ~/workspace
```

Then clone the answer key repository with the following command.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nashville-software-school/functional-react-junior
```

Running that command will make a new sub-directory of `~/workspace/functional-react-junior`. You can open that directory in Visual Studio Code by either running `code .` while in the `functional-react-junior` directory, or just opening Visual Studio Code and opening the directory manually. If you were not able to get `code .` to work yet, then on Windows, you click the file menu and choose "Open Folder", and on Mac, you click the file menu and choose "Open".

That's it. All of the code in that project is written by a grizzled, veteran software developer. It is well documented. It produces clear, concise log messages. It is highly modular and follows the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/solid-part-1-the-single-responsibility-principle--net-36074) adequately.

You won't understand it at all.

For now.

In a few months, you will be able to understand about 60% of it and be thinking "I kinda, sorta know what the other 40% does, but don't ask me to explain it."

Two years from now, understanding it will be trivial.

Five years from now, you will be able to make it better by introducing more [abstractions](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/230409).

Twenty years from now, you will be questioning your own existence as a software developer and asking questions like...

* Do we even need to write this code?
* Can't we solve this problem some other way?

One of the most amazing things about becoming a professional software developer is that it will change the way you think about everything in your life. It modifies your brain's neural network to become more efficient at identifying underlying, fundamental problems instead of being distracted by the side-effects of the problem. You will find yourself becoming a more reasonable, critical thinker.

But enough about that, let's build some projects together!
